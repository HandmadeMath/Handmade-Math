Version         | Changes        | 
----------------|----------------|
**1.2.0** | Added equality functions for `HMM_Vec2`, `HMM_Vec3`, and `HMM_Vec4`, and SSE'd `HMM_MultiplyMat4` and `HMM_Transpose`.
**1.1.5** | Added `Width` and `Height` to `HMM_Vec2`, and made it so you can supply your own `SqrtF`.
**1.1.4** | Fixed SSE being included on platforms that don't support it, and fixed divide-by-zero errors when normalizing zero vectors.
**1.1.3** | Fixed compile error in C mode
**1.1.2** | Fixed invalid HMMDEF's in the function definitions
**1.1.1** | Resolved compiler warnings on gcc and g++
**1.1**   | Quaternions! |
**1.0**   | Lots of testing |
**0.7**   | Added HMM_Vec2, and HMM_Vec4 versions of  HMM_LengthSquared, HMM_Length, and HMM_Normalize.   |
**0.6**   | Made HMM_Power faster, Fixed possible efficiency problem with HMM_Normalize, RENAMED HMM_LengthSquareRoot to HMM_LengthSquared, RENAMED HMM_RSqrtF to HMM_RSquareRootF, RENAMED HMM_SqrtF to HMM_SquareRootF, REMOVED Inner function (user should use Dot now), REMOVED HMM_FastInverseSquareRoot function declaration |
**0.5.2**   | Fixed SSE code in HMM_SqrtF and HMM_RSqrtF |
**0.5.1**   | Fixed HMM_Translate producing row-major matrices, ensured column-major order for matrices throughout |
**0.5**     | Added scalar operations on vectors and matrices, added += and -= for hmm_mat4, reconciled headers and implementations, tidied up in general |
**0.4**     | Added SSE Optimized HMM_SqrtF, HMM_RSqrtF, Removed use of C Runtime | 
**0.3**     | Added +=,-=, *=, /= for hmm_vec2, hmm_vec3, hmm_vec4 | 
**0.2b**    | Disabled warning C4201 on MSVC, Added 64bit percision on HMM_PI | 
**0.2a**    | Prefixed Macros | 
**0.2**     | Updated Documentation, Fixed C Compliance, Prefixed all functions, and added better operator overloading | 
**0.1**     | Initial Version |
